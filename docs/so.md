ยง chmod gotw filename.txt -> it changes the got to w

u have - --- --- ---
or u have -rwx rwx rwx
or u have -rw- rw- r--
it means -u g o



chmod got w filename.txt -> it change one step at time
but if u use binary
then u can change like this

$chmod 644 filename.txt -> it changes everything (if there is anything to change)
basicly, 
if u have 

-rwr--r--
and u right chmod 644 filename.txt
then nothing happends
but if you right chmod 550 filename.txt
then it changes to -> r-xr-x---
get it :)))
