Processing Text and Files (using Standar C Library functions)


1. .
File f3_01.c with 

```
$ ls -l -a
``` 
argc = 3
argc[0] = "ls"
argc[1] = "-l"
argc[2] = "-a"


Standard C library
> For some functions, adding the library it's enough. For example, for printf we only need to add "include <stdio.h>" but for others more complex functions, we need to add more stuff.


int main() 
int main(int argc, char* argv[])

```
./tollower NiraGongo
```
argc[0] = file tollower
argc[1] = "NiraGongo"

The file "tollower" will be:
```
int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {

}
```
